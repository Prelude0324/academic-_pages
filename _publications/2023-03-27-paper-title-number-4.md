**Abstract:** The contradiction between the peak shaving task of the power grid and the demand for river navigation is a critical problem faced by the cascade hydropower plants with navigation tasks. The jacking effect of interval backwater aggravates the complexity of the problem. Thus, a Mixed-Integer Linear Programming (MILP) model was established for multi-objective short-term optimal scheduling of cascade hydropower plants considering the influence of backwater. The first objective of the model is to minimize the difference between the remaining load and its average, while to minimize the difference between the downstream tailwater level and its average is the other one. After aggregating the nonlinear constraints to one function, the hexahedral grid method combined with the Special Ordered Sets of type two (SOS2) constraint was introduced to linearize the nonlinear constraints. Then the multi-objective MILP model was solved by the Normal Boundary Intersection (NBI) method. The application of the proposed method to the scheduling of cascade hydropower plants in a basin in Southwest China indicates that the method can fully consider the impact of backwater jacking, take into account the peak shaving and navigation requirements, efficiently solve the multi-objective operation problem and obtain ideal results. It can be conducted that the proposed method is effective and practical.
