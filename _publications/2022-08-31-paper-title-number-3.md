excerpt: 'High-voltage direct current (HVDC) is widely applied in large-scale hydropower transmission in China because of its long distance, large capacity and low power loss. However, when multiple hydropower stations send power by sharing one HVDC transmission channel, it is challenging to ensure the security of the sending-end power grid. To address this problem, a short-term peak-shaving model serving multiple power grids considering an HVDC channel shared (HCS) constraint is proposed. First, a daily peak-shaving model for cascade hydropower stations serving multiple power grids coupling with conventional HVDC constraints is established. Second, for the power transmission of different hydropower stations sharing one HVDC channel, the HCS constraint restructured by set-calculation is integrated into the model. Finally, the Big-M method is adopted to linearize the restructured HCS constraint to build an MILP model due to its flexibility in handling massive inequality constraints. The result from the case study shows that the proposed HCS constraint can be well coupled into the model to ensure power transmission security. The peak-valley difference in dry and flood season reduced by 37% and 21%, respectively, which indicates that the model can make full use of the flexibility of hydropower to achieve a satisfactory peak-shaving result.'
