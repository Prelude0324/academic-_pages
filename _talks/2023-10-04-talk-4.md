<h2 style="color: #24367d;">Motivation</h2>

Hydropower typically serves to regulate peak loads for power grids, resulting in fluctuating and intermittent downstream discharge. This phenomenon, known as hydropeaking, is a primary deficiency of hydropower. 

The repeated sub-daily release of turbined water disrupts the downstream hydrological regime, impeding navigation and limiting water supply. What's even more concerning, it can have severe short- and long-term repercussions on riverine ecosystems.

To alleviate the negative impacts of hydropeaking, various measures have been employed. Among them, the construction of re-regulation reservoirs downstream has emerged as a cost-effective and viable engineering solution to mitigate the frequent and rapid fluctuations resulting from turbined flow of giant hydropower plants. The following table lists some major hydropower plants and their respective re-regulation reservoir.
