This is an ongoing research, aiming to explore a nexus re-operation mode for reservoir hydropower system to balance multi-sectoral performance under uncertainty. 

<h2>Motivation</h2>

The development of renewable power sources, particularly solar and wind, is vital for mitigating climate change. However, the intermittent, variable, and seasonal characteristics of these sources necessitates enhanced power system flexibility to safeguard reliable electricity supply. 

As the largest traditional renewable energy source, hydropower, especially reservoir hydropower, could be an promising alternative. Leveraging its storage capacity and rapid response characteristics, reservoir hydropower offers unparalleled flexibility across multiple temporal and spatial scales.

However, this will not only exacerbate conflicts in hourly-to-decadal and local-to-regional water and energy demands, but also altered the subdaily-to-seasonal hydrological regime, thereby jeopardizing the stability of river ecosystems.

To balance the multi-sectoral demands (including aspects like flow, water, power, and energy) at various temporal and spatial scales , it is imperative to derive sustainable operational rules for reservoir hydropower systems, which fully harness the long-term energy storage potential and short-term load regulation capability of reservoir hydropower with diverse regulation performance, considering the complementarity inherent in natural resources (such as runoff, wind speed, and solar radiation).

Given this, this study plans to establish an integrated multi-objective, multi-scale nested model that incorporates water resource management and power system operation, aiming to derive sustainable operation rules for reservoir hydropower system to coordinate cross-sectoral conflicts.

<h2>Current Status of Major Renewable Energy Development in China</h2>

As the world's largest carbon emitter, China has ambitiously pursued the development of renewable energy sources to achieve decarbonization. Fig. 2 illustrates the development of China's major renewable power sources. 风电/光伏装机于2023年5月正式超过水电，成为中国第一/二大可再生能源。可以预见

<h2>Research Region</h2>

This study will primarily focus on the four major river basins under the jurisdiction of the China Southern Power Grid (CSG), which are important hydropower bases with total installed capacity of .


Moreover, China boasts the world's largest and most complex hydropower system. Figs. 3 provides an overview of hydropower status in China, particularly highlighting the distribution and regulatory capacity of hydropower reservoirs in southern China's river basin hydropower bases. Figs. 4 offers a snapshot of power sources within the respective provincial power grids.

<h2>Research Ideas</h2>

<div style="text-align: justify;">
Establishing a multi-timescale two-layer nested framework to explore the water-energy-ecosystem nexus in hydro-based power systems.

<div style="text-align: justify;">
The inner layer consists of a scenario-based stochastic programming model for multiple grids peak shaving operation under uncertainty originating from variable renewable energy, with an hourly resolution.

<div style="text-align: justify;">
The outer layer consists of a long-term river basin-wide multi-objective optimization model, considering objectives such as water supply, hydropower generation, shipping, and sub-daily hydrological regime (hydropeaking).
