This is an ongoing research, aiming to deriving a nexus re-operation mode for reservoir hydropower to balance multiple-sector performance. 

<h2 style="color: #24367d;">Motivation</h2>

The development of renewable power sources, particularly solar and wind, is vital for mitigating climate change. However, the intermittent, variable, and seasonal characteristics of these sources necessitates enhanced power system flexibility to safeguard reliable electricity supply. 

As the largest traditional renewable energy source, hydropower, especially reservoir hydropower, could be an promising alternative. Leveraging its storage capacity and rapid response characteristics, reservoir hydropower offers unparalleled flexibility across multiple temporal and spatial scales.

However, this will not only exacerbate conflicts in hourly-to-decade and local-to-regional water and energy demands, but also altered the sub-daily to seasonal hydrological regime, thereby jeopardizing the stability of river ecosystems.

Given this, this study plans to establish an integrated multi-objective, multi-scale nested model that incorporates water resource management and power system operation, aiming to explore sustainable re-operation mode for hydropower to coordinate cross-sectoral conflicts.

Moreover, China boasts the world's largest and most complex hydropower system. Figs. 3 provides an overview of hydropower status in China, particularly highlighting the distribution and regulatory capacity of hydropower reservoirs in southern China's river basin hydropower bases. Figs. 4 offers a snapshot of power sources within the respective provincial power grids.
