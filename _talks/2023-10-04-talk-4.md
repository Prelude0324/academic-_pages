This is an ongoing research, aiming to explore a nexus re-operation mode for reservoir hydropower system to balance multi-sectoral performance under uncertainty. 

<h2>Motivation</h2>

The development of renewable power sources, particularly solar and wind, is vital for mitigating climate change. However, the intermittent, variable, and seasonal characteristics of these sources necessitates enhanced power system flexibility to safeguard reliable electricity supply. 

As the largest traditional renewable energy source, hydropower, especially reservoir hydropower, could be an promising alternative. Leveraging its storage capacity and rapid response characteristics, reservoir hydropower offers unparalleled flexibility across multiple temporal and spatial scales.

However, this will not only exacerbate conflicts in hourly-to-decadal and local-to-regional water and energy demands, but also altered the subdaily-to-seasonal hydrological regime, thereby jeopardizing the stability of river ecosystems.

To balance the multi-sectoral demands (including requirements to flow, water, power, and energy) at various temporal and spatial scales , it is imperative to derive sustainable operational rules for reservoir hydropower systems, which fully harness the long-term energy storage potential and short-term load regulation capability of reservoir hydropower with diverse regulation performance, considering the complementarity inherent in natural resources (such as runoff, wind speed, and solar radiation). 

Fig. 2 illustrates the renewable energy supply and load dynamics in a hydro-based provincial power grid in China. The seasonal and intermittent nature of wind and solar power is clearly evident. The net load, obtained by subtracting the wind and solar power output from the original load, displays more frequent variations throughout the year.

Given this, this study plans to establish an integrated multi-objective, multi-scale nested model that incorporates water resource management and power system operation, aiming to derive sustainable operation rules for reservoir hydropower system to coordinate cross-sectoral conflicts.

<h3>China Southern Power Grid: The largest hydro-based power system</h3>

This study will primarily focus on four major river-basin hydropower bases under the jurisdiction of the China Southern Power Grid (CSG), with total installed capacity of 118 GW.

Figs. 6 provides an overview of hydropower status in China, particularly highlighting the distribution and regulatory capacity of hydropower reservoirs in southern China's river-basin hydropower bases. 

Figs. 7 offers a snapshot of power sources within the respective provincial power grids.

<h2>Research Ideas</h2>

- <div style="text-align: justify;">
  Establishing a multi-timescale two-layer nested framework to explore the water-energy-ecosystem nexus in hydro-based power systems.
  </div>

- <div style="text-align: justify;">
  The inner layer consists of a scenario-based stochastic programming model for multiple grids peak shaving operation under uncertainty originating from variable renewable energy, with an hourly resolution.
  </div>

- <div style="text-align: justify;">
  The outer layer consists of a long-term river basin-wide multi-objective optimization model, considering objectives such as water supply, hydropower generation, shipping, and sub-daily hydrological regime (hydropeaking).
  </div>

<h2>Expected Answerable Questions</h2>

- <div style="text-align: justify;">
  Which types of reservoir regulation capacity should be responsible for baseload or hydropeaking during specific stages, and at what time and to what extent should each reservoir decrease or increase its water level?
  </div>

- <div style="text-align: justify;">
  How to balance short-term hydropower regulation flexibility with long-term power generation and water supply benefits (via end-of-day water levels), while coordinating with sub-daily hydrological alternations (through hydropower output adjustments).
  </div>

- <div style="text-align: justify;">
  How are the comprehensive water demand requirements of flood control and emergency water regulation (such as saltwater intrusion prevention) limiting the role of hydropower in the power system (in terms of flexibility and power generation)?
