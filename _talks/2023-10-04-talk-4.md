This is an ongoing research, aiming to explore a nexus re-operation mode for reservoir hydropower system to balance multi-sectoral performance under uncertainty. 

<h2>Motivation</h2>

The development of renewable power sources, particularly solar and wind, is vital for mitigating climate change. However, the intermittent, variable, and seasonal characteristics of these sources necessitates enhanced power system flexibility to safeguard reliable electricity supply. 

As the largest traditional renewable energy source, hydropower, especially reservoir hydropower, could be an promising alternative. Leveraging its storage capacity and rapid response characteristics, reservoir hydropower offers unparalleled flexibility across multiple temporal and spatial scales.

However, this will not only exacerbate conflicts in hourly-to-decadal and local-to-regional water and energy demands, but also altered the subdaily-to-seasonal hydrological regime, thereby jeopardizing the stability of river ecosystems.

To balance the multi-sectoral demands (including aspects like flow, water, power, and energy) at various temporal and spatial scales , it is imperative to derive sustainable operational rules for reservoir hydropower systems, which fully harness the long-term energy storage potential and short-term load regulation capability of reservoir hydropower with diverse regulation performance, considering the complementarity inherent in natural resources (such as runoff, wind speed, and solar radiation). 下图2展示了中国一个hydro-baed省级电网 （higher than [Real-time Operating Grid - U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA)](https://www.eia.gov/electricity/gridmonitor/dashboard/electric_overview/balancing_authority/NYIS), [Real-time Operating Grid - U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA)](https://www.eia.gov/electricity/gridmonitor/dashboard/electric_overview/balancing_authority/CISO)

Given this, this study plans to establish an integrated multi-objective, multi-scale nested model that incorporates water resource management and power system operation, aiming to derive sustainable operation rules for reservoir hydropower system to coordinate cross-sectoral conflicts.

<h2>Research Region</h2>

This study will primarily focus on the four major river basins under the jurisdiction of the China Southern Power Grid (CSG), which are important hydropower bases with total installed capacity of .


Moreover, China boasts the world's largest and most complex hydropower system. Figs. 3 provides an overview of hydropower status in China, particularly highlighting the distribution and regulatory capacity of hydropower reservoirs in southern China's river basin hydropower bases. Figs. 4 offers a snapshot of power sources within the respective provincial power grids.
