This study aims to develop a multi-objective decision-making tool to support the day-ahead scheduling of hydropower systems, addressing conflicts between multiple water uses and power system demands. The study has been published, and you can access [here](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jclepro.2023.138602).

<h2 style="color: #24367d;">Motivation</h2>

Hydropower reservoir is at the heart of the water-energy nexus due to its unique role and multiple benefits in the water resource and energy systems. Effectively coordinating multiple stakeholders' interests and developing rational operation schemes is crucial. 

Therefore, this paper aims to develop a multi-objective analysis framework to support decision-making for short-term hydropower system operation, focusing on mediating the conflicts among peak shaving, ship navigation, and power generation.

Fig. 1 depicts the correspondence between stakeholders, operational tasks, and objective functions.

<h2 style="color: #24367d;">Research Gap and Contributions</h2>

**Gap:**

- Further research is needed to model navigation demands for hydropower reservoir with navigation demands (HRND)  without expanding the model scale.
- The STMOOS model poses challenges due to its high dimensionality, complex constraints, and need for accurate results. While MILP has been a popular solution due to its stable outcomes and user-friendly software, it cannot handle MOOPs and complex constraints directly, necessitating improved strategies.
- Current research falls short in decision-making methods for MOOPs, calling for a general approach that considers subjective and objective preferences.

**Contributions:**

- Proposed a navigation objective for HRNDs and combine it with the peak shaving and power generation objectives to build a STMOOS model.
- Introduced NNC and MILP methods to solve the multi-objective model and obtain Pareto solutions.
- Utilized the CW-TOPSIS method, which is based on both subjective preference and objective entropy weight, to evaluate the Pareto solutions and determine the final scheduling scheme.

<h2 style="color: #24367d;">Methodlogy</h2>

<h3 style="color: #24367d;">Normalized Normal Constraint (NNC)</h3>

Normalized Normal Constraint (NNC) is a multi-objective optimization method, whose basic idea is to use the equidistant points on the Utopia hyperplane in the normalized solution space to yield the corresponding uniformly distributed Pareto solutions along the Pareto front.

<h3 style="color: #24367d;">Technique for Order Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution (TOPSIS)</h3>

TOPSIS is a widely-used multi-attribute decision-making (MADM) method that ranks alternatives based on their distance from positive and negative ideal solutions. 

To avoid arbitrariness and excessive reliance on data diversity, a combined weighting method is employed, incorporating the entropy method and subjective preference to assign objective and subjective weights to attributes.

<h3 style="color: #24367d;">Complete framework</h3>

Fig. 10 summarizes the proposed framework, highlighting the overall modeling, solving, and decision-making processes.

<h2 style="color: #24367d;">Case Study</h2>

The proposed framework is applied to the operation of cascade hydropower reservoirs located in Wujiang River, Southwest China. Three case studies are carried out to validate the framework's effectiveness and derive a quarter-hourly operation plan  that optimizes the trade-off between peak shaving, power generation, and navigation benefits.

<h3 style="color: #24367d;">Case 1: Comparison of the results of SOOPs and MOOPs under different scenarios</h3>

In this case, the NNC is utilized to solve the multi-objective MILP model for dry and flood season scenarios to validate the proposed model and methods. It is noteworthy that to obtain the calculation parameters (including anchor points, Utopia Value, Nadir Value, etc.) of NNC, single-objective optimization is conducted on the respective objective. For simplicity, N-SOOP, S-SOOP, and P-SOOP will be referred to as the SOOP of navigation, peak shaving, and power generation.

Fig. 5-6 below are the results in the dry and flood season scenarios. Fig. 5(a)-(c) show the results of navigation, peak-shaving, and power generation under each SOOP in turn; the subplots from left to right in Fig. 5(a)-(c) are the results of the N-SOOP, S-SOOP, and P-SOOP separately. For example, Fig. 5(b3) shows the peak shaving results of the P-SOOP. Fig. 6 is arranged analogously while detailed data is provided in Table 1.

<h3 style="color: #24367d;">Case 3: Decision-making on Pareto solutions</h3>

The CW-TOPSIS method is further applied for decision-making on the Pareto solutions of the flood season scenario in Case 1.

Fig. 9 illustrates the normalized decision matrix of the Pareto solutions and each scheme’s relative proximity calculated using three methods: traditional subjective weighting TOPSIS (SW-TOPSIS), entropy weighting TOPSIS (EW-TOPSIS), and CW-TOPSIS.
