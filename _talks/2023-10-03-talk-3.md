This study aims to develop a multi-objective decision-making tool to support the day-ahead scheduling of hydropower systems, addressing conflicts between multiple water uses and power system demands. The study has been published, and you can access [here](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jclepro.2023.138602).

<h2 style="color: #24367d;">Motivation</h2>

Hydropower reservoir is at the heart of the water-energy nexus due to its unique role and multiple benefits in the water resource and energy systems. Effectively coordinating multiple stakeholders' interests and developing rational operation schemes is crucial. 

Therefore, this paper aims to develop a multi-objective analysis framework to support decision-making for short-term hydropower system operation, focusing on mediating the conflicts among peak shaving, ship navigation, and power generation.

Fig. 1 depicts the correspondence between stakeholders, operational tasks, and objective functions.

<h2 style="color: #24367d;">Research Gap and Contributions</h2>

**Gap:**

- Modeling of short-term multi-objective optimal scheduling (STMOOS)

  Due to geographical limitations or the failure to build navigable structures synchronously, not all reservoirs have navigable tasks. How to precisely satisfy the navigation demands of each HRND while avoiding further expansion of the model scale requires further research.

- Lacking an accurate, stable, and direct solution method for the STMOOS model

  Short-term scheduling of CHR presents challenges such as high dimensionality, complex constraints, and the need for precise and stable results. In recent years, MILP has emerged as a popular method in research and engineering due to its mature theory, stable outcomes, high solution accuracy, and user-friendly software. However, MILP has limitations as it cannot directly handle multi-objective optimization problems (MOOPs) and necessitates the handling of complex constraints, calling for the development of improved strategies.

- Selection of decision-making methods

  Existing research either stops at obtaining Pareto solutions or uses problem-specific decision-making methods, needing a general approach that considers both subjective and objective preferences.

**Contributions:**

- Proposed a navigation objective for HRNDs and combine it with the peak shaving and power generation objectives to build a STMOOS model.
- Introduced NNC and MILP methods to solve the multi-objective model and obtain Pareto solutions.
- Utilized the CW-TOPSIS method, which is based on both subjective preference and objective entropy weight, to evaluate the Pareto solutions and determine the final scheduling scheme.

**Normalized Normal Constraint (NNC):**

Normalized Normal Constraint (NNC) is a multi-objective optimization method, whose basic idea is to use the equidistant points on the Utopia hyperplane in the normalized solution space to yield the corresponding uniformly distributed Pareto solutions along the Pareto front.

**Technique for Order Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution:**

TOPSIS is a widely-used multi-attribute decision-making (MADM) method that ranks alternatives based on their distance from positive and negative ideal solutions.  To avoid arbitrariness and excessive reliance on data diversity, a combined weighting method is employed, incorporating the entropy method and subjective preference to assign objective and subjective weights to attributes.

**Complete framework:**

<h2 style="color: #24367d;">Case Study</h2>

The proposed framework is applied to the operation of cascade hydropower reservoir in Wujiang River, Southwest China. Three case studies are conducted to verify the framework's effectiveness and obtain a quarter-hourly operation scheme balancing the benefits of peak shaving, power generation, and navigation.
