This study aims to develop a multi-objective decision-making tool to support the day-ahead scheduling of hydropower systems, addressing conflicts between multiple water uses and power system demands. The study has been published, and you can access [here](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jclepro.2023.138602).

<h2 style="color: #24367d;">Motivation</h2>

Hydropower reservoir is at the heart of the water-energy nexus due to its unique role and multiple benefits in the water resource and energy systems. Effectively coordinating multiple stakeholders' interests and developing rational operation schemes is crucial. 

Therefore, this paper aims to develop a multi-objective analysis framework to support decision-making for hydropower system operation, focusing on mediating the conflicts among peak shaving, ship navigation, and power generation.

<h2 style="color: #24367d;">Research Gap and Contributions</h2>

**Gap:**

- Modeling of short-term multi-objective optimal scheduling (STMOOS)
- Lacking an accurate, stable, and direct solution method for the STMOOS model
- Selection of decision-making methods

**Contributions:**

- Proposed a navigation objective for HRNDs and combine it with the peak shaving and power generation objectives to build a STMOOS model.
- Introduced NNC and MILP methods to solve the multi-objective model and obtain Pareto solutions.
- Utilized the CW-TOPSIS method, which is based on both subjective preference and objective entropy weight, to evaluate the Pareto solutions and determine the final scheduling scheme.

**Normalized Normal Constraint (NNC):**

Normalized Normal Constraint (NNC) is a multi-objective optimization method, whose basic idea is to use the equidistant points on the Utopia hyperplane in the normalized solution space to yield the corresponding uniformly distributed Pareto solutions along the Pareto front.

**Technique for Order Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution:**

TOPSIS is a classical multi-attribute decision-making (MADM) method that ranks alternatives by calculating their relative distance from positive and negative ideal solutions. 权重
