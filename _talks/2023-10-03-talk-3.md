This study aims to develop a multi-objective decision-making tool to support the day-ahead scheduling of hydropower systems, addressing conflicts between multiple water uses and power system demands. The study has been published, and you can access more information [here](https://prelude0324.github.io/academic_pages/publication/2023-08-27-paper-title-number-1).

<h2 style="color: #24367d;">Motivation</h2>

Hydropower is an essential clean and renewable energy that ensures global decarbonization targets remain within reach. Due to their storage and adjustability, hydropower reservoirs offer multiple functions in addition to providing reliable electricity, such as flood control, ship navigation, environmental flows, and water supply, which can create conflicts in operation.

With the continuous growth of peak load and expected increasing share of variable renewables such as wind and solar, the pressure of power balancing is exacerbated, necessitating additional flexibility. To support grid stability, it is promising for hydropower, a large-scale and well-dispatchable renewable energy, to participate in peak shaving, i.e., hydropower peak shaving operation (HPSO). HPSO is an operation mode in which cascade hydropower reservoirs (CHR) adjust the power output processes to track varying loads through their storage capacity and fast response characteristics. However, this mode may not be optimal for other tasks of multi-purpose reservoirs or even have negative impacts, posing new challenges for hydropower operations. For power producers, HPSO may lead to lower generation efficiency, higher generation costs, or even avoidable water spillage. Additionally, HPSO can cause frequent fluctuations and rapid variations in downstream river flows and water levels, significantly affecting shipping conditions and ecosystem stability.

Indeed, hydropower is at the heart of the water-energy nexus due to its unique role and multiple benefits in the water resource and energy systems. Effectively coordinating multiple stakeholders' interests and developing rational operation schemes is crucial. Therefore, this paper aims to develop a multi-objective analysis framework to support decision-making for hydropower system operation.

<h2 style="color: #24367d;">Research Gap and Contributions</h2>

**Gap:**

- Modeling of short-term multi-objective optimal scheduling (STMOOS)
- Lacking an accurate, stable, and direct solution method for the STMOOS model
- Selection of decision-making methods

**Contributions:**

- Proposed a navigation objective for HRNDs and combine it with the peak shaving and power generation objectives to build a STMOOS model.
- Introduced NNC and MILP methods to solve the multi-objective model and obtain Pareto solutions.
- Utilized the CW-TOPSIS method, which is based on both subjective preference and objective entropy weight, to evaluate the Pareto solutions and determine the final scheduling scheme.

**Normalized Normal Constraint (NNC):**

Normalized Normal Constraint (NNC) is a multi-objective optimization method, whose basic idea is to use the equidistant points on the Utopia hyperplane in the normalized solution space to yield the corresponding uniformly distributed Pareto solutions along the Pareto front.

**Combined Weighting - Technique for Order Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution (CW-TOPSIS):**

As a classical multi-attribute decision-making method, TOPSIS ranks alternatives by calculating their relative distance from positive and negative ideal solutions.
