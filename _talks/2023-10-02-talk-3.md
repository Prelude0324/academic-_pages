This study aims to resolve the conflict between peak shaving requirements for the power grid and downstream navigation tasks by employing a multi-objective technique to co-scheduling a giant reservoir and its re-regulation reservoir.

Hydropower typically serves to regulate peak loads for power grids, resulting in fluctuating and intermittent downstream discharge. This phenomenon, known as hydropeaking, is a primary deficiency of hydropower. The repeated sub-daily release of turbined water disrupts the downstream hydrological regime, impeding navigation and limiting water supply. What's even more concerning, it can have severe short- and long-term repercussions on riverine ecosystems.

To alleviate the negative impacts of hydropeaking, various direct and indirect measures have been employed. Among these measures, the construction of re-regulation reservoirs downstream has emerged as a cost-effective and viable engineering solution to mitigate the frequent and rapid fluctuations resulting from turbined flow of giant hydropower plants. The following table lists some major hydropower plants and their respective re-regulation reservoir.

| Giant Hydropower Reservoir | Re-regulation Reservoir | River Bain    |
| -------------------------- | ----------------------- | ------------- |
| Three Gorges (22,500 MW)   | Gezhouba (2,715 MW)     | Yangtze River |
| Xiluodu (13,860 MW)        | Xiangjiaba (7,750 MW)   | Jinsha River  |
| Longtan   (4,900 MW)       | Yantan (1,810 MW)       | Peral River   |

Taking the Longtan Hydropower Station as an example, it plays a crucial role in peak-load adjustment for the Guangxi Power Grid. In 2022, its installed capacity accounted for 16% of the highest peak load (30,400 MW) and 24% of the average load (20,590 MW). However, since 2015, significant fluctuations in the downstream hydrological regime have occurred, with daily water level fluctuations up to 10.08 m and hourly discharge fluctuations up to 2371.43 $m^3/s$. These intense and frequent fluctuations pose a severe threat to the downstream ecosystem and navigation. Therefore, achieving coordinated scheduling between the Longtan and Yantan hydropower stations is imperative, motivating this research.

However, re-regulation reservoirs are typically located near upstream reservoirs, which may cause the backwater jacking effect. This phenomenon occurs when a dam obstructs water flow in a river channel, resulting in an upstream rise and extension of the water level.
