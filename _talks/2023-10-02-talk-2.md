This study aims to resolve the conflict between peak shaving requirements and downstream shipping demands by employing a multi-objective technique to co-scheduling a giant reservoir and its re-regulation reservoir.

<h2 style="color: #24367d;">Motivation</h2>

Hydropower typically serves to regulate peak loads for power grids, resulting in fluctuating and intermittent downstream discharge. This phenomenon, known as hydropeaking, is a primary deficiency of hydropower. 

The repeated sub-daily release of turbined water disrupts the downstream hydrological regime, impeding navigation and limiting water supply. What's even more concerning, it can have severe short- and long-term repercussions on riverine ecosystems.

To alleviate the negative impacts of hydropeaking, various structural and operational measures have been employed. Among them, the construction of re-regulation reservoirs downstream has emerged as a cost-effective and viable structural measure to mitigate the frequent and rapid fluctuations resulting from turbined release of giant hydropower plants. The following table lists some major hydropower plants and their respective re-regulation reservoir.

| Giant Hydropower Reservoir | Re-regulation Reservoir |  River Basin  |
| :------------------------: | :---------------------: | :-----------: |
|  Three Gorges (22,500 MW)  |   Gezhouba (2,715 MW)   | Yangtze River |
|    Xiluodu (13,860 MW)     |  Xiangjiaba (7,750 MW)  | Jinsha River  |
|    Longtan   (4,900 MW)    |    Yantan (1,810 MW)    |  Pearl River  |

Taking the Longtan Hydropower Station as an example, it plays a crucial role in peak-load adjustment for the Guangxi Power Grid. In 2022, its installed capacity accounted for 16% of the highest peak load (30,400 MW) and 24% of the average load (20,590 MW). Nevertheless, since 2015, significant fluctuations in the downstream hydrological regime have occurred, with daily water level fluctuations up to 10.08 m and hourly discharge fluctuations up to 2371.43 m³/(s·h). These intense and frequent fluctuations pose a severe threat to the downstream ecosystem and navigation.

Therefore, achieving coordinated scheduling between the giant and its corresponding re-regulation reservoir is imperative, motivating this research. However, re-regulation reservoirs are typically located near upstream reservoirs, which may cause the backwater jacking effect. This phenomenon occurs when a dam obstructs water flow in a river channel, resulting in an upstream rise and extension of the water level. Insufficient consideration may impede power output, resulting in deviations between actual and expected power generation capacities, potential water spillage, and even economic disputes.

<h2 style="color: #24367d;">Research Gap and Contributions</h2>

**Gap:**

- How to model the backwater jacking effect and handle the complex high-dimension constraints in hydropower operation
- Lack of research on modeling the conflicts between short-term peak shaving and ship navigation
- Lack of precise and stable multi-objective solution methods suitable for shot-term scheduling of cascade reservoirs

**Contributions:**

- Proposing constraint aggregation and hexahedral meshing techniques to handle complex nonlinear constraints in hydropower scheduling
- Building a multi-objective mixed-integer linear programming model to address the coupled peak shaving and shipping demands
- Introducing Normal Boundary Intersection (NBI) method to solve the multi-objective model

<h2 style="color: #24367d;">Methodlogy</h2>

**Linearization Strategies :**

The impact of backwater jacking is represented through a three-dimensional nonlinear function in relation to the tailwater level of the giant reservoir, which is dependent on the discharge and downstream reservoir water level.

Fig. 4 depicts all nonlinear constraints involved in hydropower operation, including the aforementioned constraint.

Conventional methods typically employ piecewise linearization and triangulation techniques to handle one-dimensional and two-dimensional nonlinear constraints, respectively. This study introduces a constraint aggregation strategy to transform nonlinear constraints into equivalent hydropower production function (EHPF), avoiding the need for excessive integer variables. Fig. 5 shows the contour plot of EHPF.

Furthermore, to address the EHPF, a hexahedral gridding technique is adopted along with the introduction of SOS2 (Special Ordered Sets of type 2) constraints, enabling efficient linearization.

**Normal Boundary Intersection (NBI):**

Normal Boundary Intersection (NBI) is employed to solve the multi-objective MILP model. It is an efficient solution method for multi-objective optimization problems by geometrically reducing them to weighted single-objective optimization problems.
