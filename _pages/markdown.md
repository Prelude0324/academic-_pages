<h1 style="color: #24367d;">Projects</h1>

Since I joined Institute of Hydropower and Hydroinformatics at DUT in 2021, I have been deeply involved in research projects regarding reservoir and renewable energy system operation, in which my primary responsibilities involved conducting research on sub-topics, handling and analyzing data, designing graphical user interfaces, and composing reports. After rigorous training in these projects, I have acquired solid theoretical knowledge and practical production experience in the field of water resources system management. The following is a list of partial projects:
