<h1 style="color: #24367d;">Projects</h1>

Since I joined Institute of Hydropower and Hydroinformatics at DUT, I have been deeply involved in reservoir operation modeling research. In these projects, my primary responsibilities involved conducting research on sub-topics, handling and analyzing data, designing graphical user interfaces, and composing reports. These experiences significantly developed my skills and expanded my perspective and understanding of the field.



Since I joined Professor Cheng Chuntian's team in 2018, I have been deeply involved in reservoir operation modeling research, participated in a number of National Natural Science Foundation (key and general projects), and served as the student leader of a number of crosswise tasks (actual projects of provincial power grid and hydropower Basin Companies), with an in-depth understanding of reservoir system optimization modeling and actual operation. After rigorous training in the above research projects, I have acquired solid theoretical knowledge and practical production experience in the field of water resources system management.
