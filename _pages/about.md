I'm a third year MSc student from [Faculty of Infrastructure Engineering](https://sche.dlut.edu.cn/English.htm), [Dalian University of Technology](https://en.dlut.edu.cn/). Prior to that, I earned my Bachelor's degree in Water Conservancy and Hydropower Engineering from the same university. 

I am very fortunate to be advised by [Associate Prof. Shengli Liao](http://faculty.dlut.edu.cn/2009015007/en/index/694157/list/index.htm) of Hydropower and Hydroinformatics Institute from [School of Civil & Hydraulic Engineering](https://cs.pku.edu.cn/), Dalian University of Technology and looking forward to find a suitable Ph.D. position.

# Academic Interests

My primary research interest includes hydropower (reservoir) operation, water resources management, and water-energy-ecosystem nexus. Currently, I am committed to utilizing multi-objective analysis and uncertainty optimization methods to find nexus solutions to tackle with the conflicting demands arising from multiple water uses, renewable energy systems, and riverine ecosystem service. So far, I have developed some Python-based tools to support multi-objective decision-making of hydropower system in China.
