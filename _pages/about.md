<h1>About me</h1>

I am a third-year master's student at [Dalian University of Technology (DUT)](https://en.dlut.edu.cn/), specializing in Hydrology and Water Resources. 

Since joining the Institute of Hydropower and Hydroinformatics at DUT in 2021, I have been deeply involved in reservoir operation research. This experience has ignited my passion for studying the water-energy nexus and sustainable water management. 

I am now actively seeking a Ph.D. position to advance my academic and research pursuits. Please review this website and following links for additional information.

<h1>Research Interests</h1>

My research interests primarily lie in reservoir (hydropower) operation, the water-energy-ecosystem nexus, and water resources management. 

Currently, I am dedicated to utilizing multi-objective optimization and uncertainty analysis techniques to find nexus solutions that address conflicting demands from multiple water uses, renewable energy systems, and riverine ecosystem services [(More information here)](https://prelude0324.github.io/academic_pages/talks/2023-10-04-talk-4).

In the future, I aspire to further my research in sustainable management of water-energy systems, leveraging optimization, deep learning, and other relevant theories to support decision-making for these complex systems under the influence of climate change (e.g. extreme hydrological conditions and higher renewable energy penetration rates).



<h1>Academic Achievements</h1>

I have published a first-authored [academic paper](https://prelude0324.github.io/academic_pages/publication/2023-08-27-paper-title-number-1) in the Journal of Cleaner Production (JCR Q1, IF=11.1), focusing on coordinating the conflicts among multiple water uses and power system demands in reservoir hydropower system operation. 

Additionally, I have co-authored two SCI papers and one EI paper on topics related to runoff forecasting and hydropower operation. My accomplishments have been recognized through awards such as the science & technology star scholarship and excellent graduate of DUT.



<h1>Personal Life</h1>

I was born and raised in Liaoning Province, China. During my free time, I enjoy watching movies and playing musical instruments.
