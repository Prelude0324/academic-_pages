I am a third-year master's student at [Dalian University of Technology, DUT](https://en.dlut.edu.cn/), specializing in Hydrology and Water Resources. Prior to that, I obtained my Bachelor's degree in Water Conservancy and Hydropower Engineering from the same university.

I feel privileged to be a part of the Institute of Hydropower and Hydroinformatics at DUT, where I have actively participated in innovative research projects focusing on hydropower and renewable energy operations. This experience has ignited my passion for studying sustainable water management and the water-energy nexus. Currently, I am actively seeking a suitable Ph.D. position to advance my academic and research pursuits.

# Research Interests

My research interests primarily lie in reservoir (hydropower) operation, water resources management, and the water-energy-ecosystem nexus. Currently, I am dedicated to utilizing multi-objective optimization and uncertainty analysis techniques to find nexus solutions that address conflicting demands from multiple water uses, renewable energy systems, and riverine ecosystem services.

If given the opportunity to obtain a Ph.D. position, I aspire to further my research in sustainable management of water-energy infrastructure, supporting decision analytics for such complex systems under climate changes by leveraging optimization, deep learning, and other theories.

# Academic Achievements

So far, I have published an academic paper in Journal of Cleaner Production (JCR Q1, IF=11.1), focusing on multi-objective decision-making analysis for cascade hydropower reservoirs. Additionally, I have co-authored two SCI papers and one EI paper, addressing topics related to runoff forecasting and hydropower operation. Additionally, I have won some awards such as excellent graduate and first prize scholarship of DUT.

# Personal Background

I was born and raised in Liaoning Province, China in 1999. During my free time, I enjoy watching movies and playing musical instruments.
